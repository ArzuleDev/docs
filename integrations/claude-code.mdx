Get complete observability into your Claude Code sessions with automatic tracing of tool calls, LLM interactions, and turn-by-turn workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Claude Code installed and working
- An Arzule account

## Quick Setup (3 steps)

### Step 1: Install the SDK

```bash
pip install arzule-ingest
```

### Step 2: Configure credentials

Get your credentials from [app.arzule.com/settings](https://app.arzule.com/dashboard/settings), then run:

```bash
arzule configure
```

Enter your API Key, Tenant ID, and Project ID when prompted.

### Step 3: Install hooks

```bash
arzule claude install
```

That's it. Start using Claude Code normally and traces will appear in your Arzule dashboard.

## How it works

Arzule installs hooks into Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json` that capture events during your coding sessions:

- **Session lifecycle** - Session start/end
- **Turns** - Each prompt-response cycle (user prompt to completion)
- **Tool calls** - File reads, writes, terminal commands, search operations
- **Handoffs** - When Claude delegates to subagents

Each turn (from user prompt to stop) is treated as a discrete "run" in Arzule, giving you clean separation of work units within long-running sessions.

## Verification

Check that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
arzule claude status
```

You should see:

```
Claude Code Integration Status
========================================
Installed: Yes
Settings Path: ~/.claude/settings.json
Hooks installed: 9
  - SessionStart
  - SessionEnd
  - UserPromptSubmit
  - PreToolUse
  - PostToolUse
  - SubagentStop
  - Stop
  - PreCompact
  - Notification

Configuration (~/.arzule/config):
  ARZULE_API_KEY: Set
  ARZULE_TENANT_ID: Set
  ARZULE_PROJECT_ID: Set

  Ready! Traces will be sent to your Arzule dashboard.
```

## View your traces

Open your [Arzule dashboard](https://app.arzule.com/dashboard/overview) to see captured traces. Each turn shows:

- Complete tool call timeline with inputs/outputs
- LLM request and response details
- Execution flow and handoffs
- File operations and code changes

## Alternative: Shell integration

For additional OTel metrics (token usage, costs), set up shell integration:

```bash
arzule setup
```

This adds environment variables to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). After restarting your terminal or running `source ~/.zshrc`, all `claude` commands will automatically send metrics to Arzule.

## Uninstalling

To remove Arzule hooks from Claude Code:

```bash
arzule claude uninstall
```

To remove shell integration:

```bash
arzule setup-remove
```

## Project-level installation

Install hooks for a specific project instead of globally:

```bash
arzule claude install --project /path/to/project
```

This creates `.claude/settings.json` in the project directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks installed but no traces appearing

1. Check your configuration: `arzule config`
2. Verify hooks are installed: `arzule claude status`
3. Check for local trace files in `~/.arzule/traces/` (traces save here if backend is unreachable)

### Configuration not found

Run `arzule configure` to set up your credentials. You can find them at [app.arzule.com/settings](https://app.arzule.com/dashboard/settings).

### Reinstalling hooks

If hooks seem corrupted, force reinstall:

```bash
arzule claude uninstall
arzule claude install
```
