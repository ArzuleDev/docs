Events are the atomic units of observability in Arzule. Every action your agents take is recorded as a structured event.

## Event format

All events follow the `trace_event.v0_1` schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "trace_event.v0_1",
  "run_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "tenant_id": "your-tenant-id",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "trace_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678abcdef01",
  "span_id": "1234567890abcdef",
  "parent_span_id": "0987654321fedcba",
  "seq": 42,
  "ts": "2025-12-24T07:12:03.123Z",
  "agent": {
    "id": "crewai:role:Researcher",
    "role": "Researcher"
  },
  "event_type": "tool.call.start",
  "status": "ok",
  "summary": "Calling WebSearch tool",
  "attrs_compact": {
    "tool_name": "WebSearch",
    "query": "AI safety research papers 2025"
  }
}
```

## Event types

### Run lifecycle

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `run.start` | A new run has begun |
| `run.end` | The run has completed |

### Crew execution

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `crew.kickoff.start` | Crew execution starting |
| `crew.kickoff.complete` | Crew finished successfully |
| `crew.kickoff.failed` | Crew execution failed with error |

### Agent activity

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `agent.execution.start` | An agent began working |
| `agent.execution.complete` | An agent finished its work |

### Task progress

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `task.start` | A task began execution |
| `task.complete` | A task finished successfully |
| `task.failed` | A task failed with error |

### Tool calls

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tool.call.start` | A tool invocation began |
| `tool.call.end` | A tool invocation completed |

### LLM calls

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `llm.call.start` | An LLM request was sent |
| `llm.call.end` | An LLM response was received |

### Handoffs

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `handoff.proposed` | An agent proposed handing off to another |
| `handoff.ack` | The receiving agent acknowledged the handoff |
| `handoff.complete` | The handoff finished |

## Event attributes

Events include contextual data in `attrs_compact`:

```json
{
  "event_type": "llm.call.end",
  "attrs_compact": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "prompt_tokens": 1250,
    "completion_tokens": 456,
    "latency_ms": 2340
  }
}
```

Common attributes by event type:

| Event Type | Common Attributes |
|------------|-------------------|
| `tool.call.*` | `tool_name`, `inputs`, `outputs` |
| `llm.call.*` | `model`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `latency_ms` |
| `task.*` | `task_id`, `description`, `agent_role` |
| `handoff.*` | `from_agent`, `to_agent`, `reason` |

## Status values

The `status` field indicates the outcome:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ok` | Completed successfully |
| `error` | Failed with an error |
| `blocked` | Blocked by a policy or constraint |
| `null` | Status not yet determined (for start events) |

## Sequence numbers

The `seq` field is a monotonically increasing integer that orders events within a run. This guarantees you can always reconstruct the exact sequence of events, even if timestamps have clock skew.
