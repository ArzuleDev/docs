description: "Understanding how Arzule captures and structures agent execution data"
---

A **trace** represents a complete execution path through your multi-agent system. When you run a crew, pipeline, or any agent workflow, Arzule captures every action as a structured trace.

## Trace structure

Each trace consists of:

- **Trace ID** - A unique 32-character hex identifier for the entire execution
- **Spans** - Individual units of work within the trace
- **Events** - Discrete actions that occur within spans

```
Trace (trace_id: abc123...)
├── Span: crew.kickoff
│   ├── Event: crew.kickoff.start
│   ├── Span: agent.execution (Researcher)
│   │   ├── Event: agent.execution.start
│   │   ├── Span: tool.call (WebSearch)
│   │   │   ├── Event: tool.call.start
│   │   │   └── Event: tool.call.end
│   │   └── Event: agent.execution.complete
│   ├── Span: agent.execution (Writer)
│   │   └── ...
│   └── Event: crew.kickoff.complete
```

## Spans and parent relationships

Spans represent units of work with a beginning and end. Each span has:

- **span_id** - 16-character hex identifier
- **parent_span_id** - Links to the parent span (null for root spans)

This hierarchy lets you understand exactly how work flows through your agents.

## Trace IDs vs Run IDs

| ID Type | Purpose | Scope |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `trace_id` | Groups related spans/events | Single execution path |
| `run_id` | Groups all traces in a run | Entire crew.kickoff() call |
| `span_id` | Identifies a unit of work | Individual operation |

A single `run_id` may contain multiple `trace_id` values if your agents spawn parallel work.

## Viewing traces

### In the dashboard

The Arzule dashboard provides a visual timeline of your traces with:

- Waterfall view of span timing
- Event details and payloads
- Error highlighting
- Search and filtering

### With the CLI

View traces locally during development:

```bash
# Timeline view
arzule view traces.jsonl

# Table format
arzule view traces.jsonl -f table

# Statistics
arzule stats traces.jsonl
```

## Trace data retention

Traces are retained based on your plan:

| Plan | Retention |
|------|-----------|
| Free | 7 days |
| Pro | 30 days |
| Enterprise | Configurable |

<Note>
Traces can be exported at any time before the retention period expires.
