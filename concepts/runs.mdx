description: "Grouping traces for complete execution visibility"
---

A **run** represents a complete execution of your agent system, from start to finish. When you call `crew.kickoff()`, Arzule creates a run that contains all traces generated during that execution.

## Run vs trace

| Concept | Scope | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Run | Complete execution | One `crew.kickoff()` call |
| Trace | Single execution path | One agent's work |
| Span | Unit of work | One tool call |
| Event | Atomic action | Tool call started |

A single run typically contains one primary trace, but may include multiple traces if agents spawn parallel work.

## Run lifecycle

```
Run Created
    │
    ├── run.start event
    │
    ├── Trace 1: Main crew execution
    │   ├── Agent 1 spans and events
    │   └── Agent 2 spans and events
    │
    ├── (Optional) Trace 2: Parallel work
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── run.end event
    │
Run Complete
```

## Creating runs

### Automatic (recommended)

When you call `arzule_ingest.init()`, runs are created automatically:

```python
import arzule_ingest

arzule_ingest.init()

# Each kickoff creates a new run
result = crew.kickoff()  # Run 1
result = crew.kickoff()  # Run 2
```

### Manual control

For more control, use the `ArzuleRun` context manager:

```python
from arzule_ingest import ArzuleRun
from arzule_ingest.sinks import JsonlFileSink

sink = JsonlFileSink("traces.jsonl")

with ArzuleRun(
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    project_id="your-project-id",
    sink=sink
) as run:
    # Everything inside this block is part of this run
    result = crew.kickoff()
    
    # Access the run_id if needed
    print(f"Run ID: {run.run_id}")
```

## Run metadata

Each run includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `run_id` | UUID identifying the run |
| `tenant_id` | Your tenant identifier |
| `project_id` | The project this run belongs to |
| `started_at` | Timestamp when the run began |
| `ended_at` | Timestamp when the run completed |
| `status` | Final status (success, error, etc.) |

## Viewing runs

In the Arzule dashboard, runs are the primary navigation unit. You can:

- Filter runs by date range, status, or project
- See run duration and event counts
- Drill into individual traces within a run
- Compare runs to identify regressions

## Run isolation

Each run is isolated. Events from one run never mix with another, even if runs execute concurrently. This is guaranteed by:

1. Unique `run_id` per execution
2. Monotonic `seq` numbers within each run
3. Thread-safe event collection
