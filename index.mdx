Arzule provides complete visibility into your AI agent workflows. Automatically capture traces, detect anomalies, and debug agent behavior across your entire system.

## Why Arzule?

Multi-agent systems are complex. When agents hand off work, make tool calls, or interact with LLMs, understanding what happened and why is critical. Arzule gives you:

- **Automatic trace capture** - Instrument once, capture everything
- **Full execution visibility** - See every agent action, tool call, and LLM request
- **PII protection** - Automatic redaction of sensitive data before it leaves your system

## How it works

```python
import arzule_ingest

# Initialize once at startup
arzule_ingest.init()

# Your agent code runs as normal - traces are captured automatically
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI safety"})
```

Agent execution, tool calls, and more are captured automatically.

## What gets captured

The SDK automatically captures the complete lifecycle of your agent runs:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `run.start` / `run.end` | Run lifecycle boundaries |
| `crew.kickoff.*` | Crew execution start, complete, and failures |
| `agent.execution.*` | Individual agent activity |
| `task.*` | Task progress and completion |
| `tool.call.*` | Tool invocations and results |
| `llm.call.*` | LLM requests and responses |
| `handoff.*` | Agent-to-agent handoffs |
