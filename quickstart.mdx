This guide walks you through installing the Arzule SDK and capturing your first traces from a CrewAI application.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A CrewAI application (or other supported agent framework)
- An Arzule account with API credentials

## Step 1: Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install arzule-ingest[crewai]
```

```bash poetry
poetry add arzule-ingest[crewai]
```

```bash uv
uv add arzule-ingest[crewai]
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
If you're not using CrewAI, install just the core SDK with `pip install arzule-ingest`.
</Note>

## Step 2: Set environment variables

Configure your Arzule credentials. You can find these in your [Arzule dashboard](https://app.arzule.com).

```bash
export ARZULE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export ARZULE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
export ARZULE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

Add a single line to your application startup:

```python
import arzule_ingest

# Initialize with environment variables
arzule_ingest.init()
```

That's it. Your CrewAI code runs exactly as before, but now every execution is traced.

## Step 4: Run your agent

Execute your crew as normal:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Define your agents and tasks
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information",
    backstory="You are a skilled researcher."
)

task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI safety",
    expected_output="A summary of key findings",
    agent=researcher
)

crew = Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task])

# Run the crew - traces are captured automatically
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Step 5: View your traces

Open your [Arzule dashboard](https://app.arzule.com) to see the captured traces. You'll see:

- The complete execution timeline
- Each agent's actions and decisions
- Tool calls with inputs and outputs
- LLM requests and responses

## Full example

Here's a complete working example:

```python
import os
import arzule_ingest
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Set credentials (or use environment variables)
os.environ["ARZULE_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
os.environ["ARZULE_TENANT_ID"] = "your-tenant-id"
os.environ["ARZULE_PROJECT_ID"] = "your-project-id"

# Initialize Arzule
arzule_ingest.init()

# Your CrewAI application
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information on any topic",
    backstory="You are a meticulous researcher with attention to detail."
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Create clear, engaging content",
    backstory="You are a skilled technical writer."
)

research_task = Task(
    description="Research the benefits of multi-agent AI systems",
    expected_output="A bullet list of key benefits with examples",
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post based on the research",
    expected_output="A 500-word blog post",
    agent=writer
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task]
)

# Execute - all traces captured automatically
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```
